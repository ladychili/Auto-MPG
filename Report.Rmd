# Introduction

This practical analyse the pairwise relationships of MPG against displacement, horsepower, weight and acceleration. Linear models, bin smooth models and B-spline models are implemented based on each of the four predictors of MPG. The fit of these models is evaluated by RSS and a measure of generalisation error, in this case, AIC.


# Linear Models


x-axis, degree 1-10

y-axis, RSS  figure 1
y-axis, AIC  figure 2
y-axis, 10-fold CV MSE  figure 3



## Displacement as Predictor

```{r lm-disp}
lm.disp <- lm(mpg ~ displacement)
plot(mpg~displacement)
abline(coef(lm.disp))
```


# Bin Smooth Models

Choose a *size* of bin??? why this??

Decreasing the number of bins (increasing the size) would increase RSS, and increasing the number of bins (reducing the size) would lessen RSS. Excess bins (bin length too small) can leads to overfitting, despite the lower RSS.



# B-spline Models

Choose *number of knot* and *poly degree*???


# Conclusion

... has the best predictive ability,
